# LISTzilla
LISTzilla is an APP for Iphone to help you take track about Godzilla movie and next, in the future, add all Tokasatsu movie and series. In this APP you will find some Godzilla movie categorized in their ERA, every movie has it's original japanese movie poster, Western Name, Original Japanese name with translittarization, release date, movie directors and monster design and monster renders. I take inspiration from BOOKS and LETTERBOXD. It's a Raw project with hardcoding, but i considerate myself satisfied for someone who has 0 background in coding and design. I hope to go more in deep in coding in a way that i can deliver a proper application for us Kaiju and Tokusatsu Enjoyer and for everyone who wants to dive in this world.
